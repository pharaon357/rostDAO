# rostDAO

**rostDAO** is a Java package that simplifies the use of the **DAO (Data Access Object) design pattern** by providing ready-to-use implementations for data management.  
It reduces code duplication, improves security, and makes it easier to integrate multiple storage backends such as SQL databases, CSV files, and XML files.
